## Contribution

Pull requests are highly welcomed. The codebase is messy and I will appreciate if you start with minor changes. Check out the [data model]before contributing.

The codebase is gradually transitioning from **vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript** while maintaining compatibility with the existing generation pipeline and old `.map` user files.

The expected **future** architecture is based on a separation between **world data**, **procedural generation**, **interactive editing**, and **rendering**. The application is conceptually divided into four main layers: world data and styles (state), generators (model), editors (controllers), renderers (view).

Flow:
settings → generators → world data → renderer
UI → editors → world data → renderer.

The data layer must contain no logic and no rendering code. Generators implement the procedural world simulation. Editors implement interactive editing tools used by the user. They perform controlled mutations of the world state. Editors can be viewed as interactive generators. The renderer converts the world state into SVG or WebGl graphics. Renderer must be pure visualization step and not modify world data.
